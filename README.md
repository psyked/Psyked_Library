A collection of useful ActionScript 3 classes and libraries that I found useful during my time as a Flex / Flash / ActionScript 3 developer.

Pretty much useless now, and the important code is backed up elsewhere, but I'm worries about deleting this repository in the event that I actually ever need it again.
